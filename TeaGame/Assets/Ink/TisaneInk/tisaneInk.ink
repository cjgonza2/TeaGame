Are you sure this is what you want?
Yes.
I just want to make sure you thought this through.
I have... For the first time I'm sure this is what I want.
You've never even been outside the city.
How bad can it be?
Have you even talked to anyone who does something like this?
No...because they're out there.
Not Here...
Why does it have to be you?
It doesn't.
But I want to do something that matters.
Besides...
How hard can it be?
